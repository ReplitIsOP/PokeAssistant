Visit https://github.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/stargazers and click the star button

**Sadly majority of the Pok√©two users don't know what's Github :cry:**

### Step 1.7: Enable Developer Mode
In The Discord application go to Settings > Appearance > Turn on `Developer Mode`.

### Step 1.9: Creating a bot account
Don't worry, it's super simple.
#### Creating the application
To create the application, head to https://discord.com/developers/applications/. Log in, and you'll reach a page that may look like this:

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/660518707134595095/830720086921707540/1.png)

Click on **Create an application**. This brings you to the following page, in which you should simply enter a name for the application. After clicking **Create**, you can also add an avatar. Click **Save Changes** afterwards.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720419568418857/2.png)

#### Creating the bot account
After creating the application, we need to create the Bot User. Go to the `Bot` section on the left, then click on **Add Bot**, then **Yes, Do it**.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720692583923723/3.png)

There's a few things you can change here. 
- Username: Change your bot's username on Discord
- Icon: Change the bot's avatar
- Public bot: Toggles the ability for other users to add your bot to their server.
- Require Oauth2 Code Grant: Don't check this. Just, don't.

After doing these, scroll down.
#### Enabling Intents
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836614489712754749/11.jpg)

**Enable those things shown in Pic-**
- Presence Intent
- Server Members Intent
- Click `Save Changes`

#### Adding to your server
To generate the invite link, click on **Oauth2** in the app page, and scroll down to **Scopes**. Check the **Bot** scope to generate a link. You can also add additional permissions for the bot.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720814994161664/4.png)

Copy the link and open it, select your server and click on **Authorize**. Cheers, it has been added to your server.
#### Getting the token
Go back to the **Bot** page and copy the token. Save it somewhere, you will need that later.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720955277508628/5.png)


### Step 2: Hosting the bot
The bot will be hosted on Replit, so you need to create a Replit account first: https://replit.com/login.
#### Getting the code
The code has already been setup, you only need to go to https://replit.com/@ButterTaurus/PokeAssistant and click `fork`. Wait 10-60 seconds after forking.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/567692673440546876/850608211765886996/5.png)

#### Configuration

**PC Users**: Click on `Secrets (Environment Variables)`, it's a Lock Icon

**Mobile Users**: Click Commands Tab, click dropdown menu if the body is blank; Click `Secrets (Environment Variables)`

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836619338051878923/12.jpg)

#### First Secret
- Click `Secrets (Environment Variables)`
- Type `TOKEN` in Key Section
- Paste Bot Token in Value Section
- Click `Add new Secret`

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836619330636480553/13.jpg)

#### Second Secret
- Type `CHANNEL` in Key Section
- Paste the Channel IDs (Separate with `,` without space if there are more than one) of Pok√©mon Spawning Channels in Value Section
- Click `Add new Secret`

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836619328748257310/14.jpg)

#### Third Secret
- Type `OWNER` in Key Section

- Click `Add new Secret`

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/717711311261401159/839115777889271858/19.png)
(Mobile users will click green **play** button to run)
(PC users will click Green **Run** Button.)

The bot should be online now!

### Step 3: Keeping the bot online (Optional)
Replit shuts down projects that are inactive for over 5 minutes. The current code should already keep it up, but some users feedback that it doesn't. We will be using Uptime Robot to keep it up here. Create an account first: https://uptimerobot.com/signUp.

After signing up, login and go to the Dashboard, click on **Create New Monitor**, the configurations are as follows:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830758495824510986/8.png)

- Monitor Type: Choose HTTP(s)
- Friendly Name: Literally anything
- URL (or IP): Put `your repl`'s link. Repl links are [these](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830757823549276160/7.png) and mobile users will click `web` button to get the repl link.
- Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes

Finally click **Create Monitor** and you're done! Done with everything!

### Keep in Mind
- The bot will identify 1 Pok√©mon every 10 seconds; if there are multiple spawns in 10 seconds, the bot will get rate limited (5 seconds for premium)
- Reduce the number of channels in `Secrets (Environment Variables)` if the bot gets rate limited too many times
- The bot must have permissions to send embeds
- Make sure the `Keys` in `Secrets (Environment Variables)` are `UPPERCASE`.
- Make sure the bot can DM the owner
- Do not show the bot token to others
- Do not edit the code, because it will break the whole bot :/
- You can only have 2 Pok√©Assistants.

## Questions
### Why is the source code messed up?
It's encrypted/obfuscated. I don't want Pok√©two mods to read and patch against it and also don't want other coders to make an auto-catcher with the help of PokeAssistant.  But you can run it without problem!
### Why can't I invite the bot instead of hosting it?
Discord does not verify these kind of bots, verified bots must be unique. Server limit for unverified bots is 100 and bots in 1K+ servers need too much ram. That means you can't invite it to your server, if it's in 100 servers already üòµ. With the help of this guide, you can make your own bot and customize it without coding!
### Want to help?
Star the repository, refer your friends to this Github repository! Join the support server to request faster results, no ads and decreased rate limit! You must create a support ticket to contact the moderators.
### Is it harmful?
The bot is not against Discord TOS. But do not show your bot token to others.
### How do I restart the bot?
Type `prefix!reboot` to reboot your bot! Ping your bot to see the prefix.
### How do I update the code?
Updating is optional. If the bot asks you to update, that means it's a push-over (not optional) you need to update the code or the bot will not work.
For updating, copy this [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/main/src/index.js). Go to https://replit.com/repls and click your Pok√©Assistant REPL. After the editor has loaded, select all codes and press backspace to clear everything from the file. Now paste the copied code. Now delete `json.sqlite`(**Mobile**: Click `files` button and click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` beside `json.sqlite`), now press Run/Play Button. Make sure Run/Play button now looks like a square. (Not a triangle)
